===========================
CC Python Project
===========================

.. contents::

A cookiecutter for a Python Project. Contains my personal preferences and opinions.

Features
--------

* Testing with ``pytest``
* Reproducable testing with ``tox``
* A correct Python Package with a ``setup.py``
* Requirements freezing workflow with ``pip-tools``
* Python 3 only

N.B.: This is aimed at being a starting point for a Python project, not a python library. I would have included tools publishing to PyPI and potentially 2/3 compatability if that was the aim.

Quickstart
----------

Install cookiecutter:

``$ pip install cookiecutter``

Scaffold a project:

``$ cookiecutter gh:mthpower/cc-python-project``

And follow the prompts.
